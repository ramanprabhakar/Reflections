Using FC (file compare) command we can compare two files or two verisons of the same file and it lists the differences between the two files including addition or deletion of lines or typos.
Manually doing this will surely take a lot of time and won't be feasible for large files.
Thanks for introducing me to this new concept !



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?



How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
